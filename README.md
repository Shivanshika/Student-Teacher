# Student-Teacher
#Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
Not all students are that comfortable with asking their queries to their teacher, mainly in primary classes.So this is a project idea based on improving interaction between students and teacher using AI.
## Background
This idea will enable a teacher to know wether the students are getting his/her point or not , and also wether they are focusing in the class or not. Often many students hesitate in telling their teacher that they didn't get the explanation of something ,this might result in some decrease in their interest in the topic.   And,eventually they might not get the topic properly.So,this project idea will help such students.

## How is it used?
This idea can be used by creating an AI based model which can learn from the facial expressions of the students and tell wether the students are getting a topic or not and also wether they are focusing in the class or not.The user of the device will be the teacher who'll time to time get notified with the percentage of students in the class getting , not getting or not focusing on the topic .So,basically here the input is the facial expressions of the students in the class and output is the percentage. If it turns out that a good percentage of students aren't getting what the teacher is explaining,the teacher could repeat the explanation or try to explain in a better way and thereby help the students in getting the topic,thus, building there interest in the topic and also helping them improve at studies by understanding rather more properly.

## Data sources and AI methods
We can use facial expressions of students in various ongoing actual classes as the data and train the model to classify with a whole lot of such data.

## Challenges
In case the student is talking with someone or interacting with teacher or facing somwhere else or performing some unusual actions, this might lead to noises during training of the data. 

## What next?

It could be improved by modelling it such that it may tell the teacher wether there's a need to give the same explanation again or to change the way of explaining . It might also be improved to tell the teacher that there's a need to give the students some sort of refreshment( which  could either be using some funny ways to teach or something else).The model can do this by computing or going through the previous results it provided during that particular calss.
This can actually lead to a much better understanding and interaction between the teacher and the students.


## Acknowledgments
I am also a student and therefore got inspired from personal experiences.Generally what happen is that if some student's don't get a topic they don't tell their teacher either out of hesitation or out of fear of being laughed at by others in case they ask any nonsense question. Consequently either they don't get the topic or end-up having a tutor considering that the teacher doesn't explain good.
So,every student should be able to understand properly ,and there personal fears or hesitation shouldn't make them lag behind.
In this AI will help them.
